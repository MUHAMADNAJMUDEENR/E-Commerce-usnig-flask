Frontend: HTML, CSS
Deployment: Render (Cloud Hosting)
Web Server: Gunicorn (for production)
Session Management: Flask sessions
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (preferably 3.9 or higher)
Git (for version control)
pip (Python package installer)
If you're using a virtual environment (recommended), you'll also need virtualenv or venv.

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/E-Commerce-usnig-flask.git
cd E-Commerce-usnig-flask
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the project. Here's how you can set it up:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
For MacOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the required libraries like Flask and Gunicorn.

4. Run the Application Locally
To start the application locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Deploying to Render
If you want to deploy the app to Render, follow these steps:

Create a Render Account: If you don't have one, sign up at Render.

Connect GitHub to Render: Link your GitHub account to Render, so you can easily deploy the project.

Create a New Web Service:

Select New Web Service.
Choose GitHub as the source.
Select your repository from the list.
Set the environment to Python.
Add the following in the Build Command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
For the Start Command, use:
bash
Copy code
gunicorn app:app
Deploy: Click Deploy, and Render will automatically build and deploy your app.

File Structure
Here is a quick overview of the project files:

bash
Copy code
E-Commerce-usnig-flask/
├── app.py             # Main application file (Flask)
├── Procfile           # Specifies the web server (Gunicorn) to use for production
├── requirements.txt   # Lists the project's dependencies
├── runtime.txt        # Specifies Python version (optional, for Render deployment)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
How the Application Works
Home Page: Displays all the products. Each product has an "Add to Cart" button.
Cart Page: Displays all products added to the cart and the total price.
Checkout Page: Collects the user's name and address to complete the purchase. Once the user submits the form, the cart is cleared, and a success message is shown.
